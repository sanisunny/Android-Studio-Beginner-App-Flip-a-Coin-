# Android-Studio-Beginner-App-Flip-a-Coin-

This is a simple application that flips a coin and presents the outcome (Heads or Tails) at the press of a button. I worked with OnClickListeners, Images, the
Random math function, and equating values. I hope to expand on this by adding animation to the coin itself.
